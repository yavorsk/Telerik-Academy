Excellent material, a thorough analysis on MS SQL performance optimization. Book chapters are well structured with lots of examples. I enjoyed reading it a couple of times!

I will suggest this book for DBAs and SQL Programmers who want to know the theories behind Index and Statistics, Blocking and Deadlocking + Fragmentation.
