    <!--1. Write functions for working with shapes in  standard Planar coordinate system
    Points are represented by coordinates P(X, Y)
    Lines are represented by two points, marking their beginning and ending
    L(P1(X1,Y1), P2(X2,Y2))
    Calculate the distance between two points
    Check if three segment lines can form a triangle-->
